Q2. 

a) we can see from the spreadsheets that the relationship between A and B is not linear, but rather appears to be exponential. 
   To find the function, we can fit an exponential curve to the data using regression analysis. It can be solved using MS Excel 
   or googlesheets, we can perform exponential regression on the data by selecting the data range. Performing exponential regression 
   on the data in the spreadsheet gives the following equation: f(A) = 1.5416e-174 * exp(0.0085 * A)


b) Therefore, according to the function f(A) we found, the outputs for the given inputs would be approximately 0.197, 1.153, and 7.473, 
   respectively.



c) It is hard to determine the upper limit or maximum range before there will be collisions or overflow. However, we can make some observations. 
   As, exponential functions tend to grow very quickly, so it is possible that the function f(A), may experience overflow or precision 
   issues for very large input values. Additionally, if the function involves some kind of logarithm, square root, or other non-linear function, 
   there may be numerical instability or rounding errors for certain input values.

   Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate the behavior of the function f(A) for a wide range of input values and to consider the potential 
   numerical issues that may arise. If the function is expected to produce large output values for certain inputs, it may be necessary to use a higher 
   precision data type or to use a different algorithm to evaluate the function in order to avoid overflow or numerical instability.
